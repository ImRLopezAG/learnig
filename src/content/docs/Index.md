# Learning

This is a repo where I will be documenting my learning journey, I will be adding some notes, examples, references, and some useful links.

The platform that I will be using is [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), it is a great tool to take notes and organize your knowledge, the plugins that I will be using are:

* [Obsidian Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git)
* [Exalidraw](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin)

## Journey

* [SQL](./notes/sql)
* [Testing](./notes/testing/)
