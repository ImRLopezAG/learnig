* **Explanation:** Beyond basic joins, understanding advanced joins like self joins and cross joins can be beneficial.

### **Self Join:**

Used to join a table with itself.

### **Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT a.column1, b.column2
FROM table_name a, table_name b
WHERE a.common_column = b.common_column;
```

### **Example:**

```sql
SELECT e1.first_name AS 'Employee', e2.first_name AS 'Manager'
FROM employees e1
JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id;
```

### **Use Case:**

Finding the manager for each employee within the same employees table.

### **Cross Join:**

Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables.

### **Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
```

### **Example:**

```sql
SELECT e.first_name, p.project_name
FROM employees e
CROSS JOIN projects p;
```

### **Use Case:**

Generating all possible combinations of employees and projects.
