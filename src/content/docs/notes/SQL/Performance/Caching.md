### **Explanation:**

Caching involves storing frequently accessed data in memory to reduce database load and improve query performance.

### **Strategies:**

* Use application-level caching (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
* Utilize database-level caching mechanisms.
* Implement query results caching for expensive operations.
* Cache static data that rarely changes.
