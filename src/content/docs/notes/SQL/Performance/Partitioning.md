### **Explanation:**

Partitioning divides a table into smaller, more manageable pieces, improving query performance and maintenance.

### **Types of Partitioning:**

* **Range Partitioning:** Based on a range of values.
* **List Partitioning:** Based on a list of values.
* **Hash Partitioning:** Based on a hash function.
* **Composite Partitioning:** Combination of the above methods.

### **Syntax:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    hire_date DATE,
    department VARCHAR(50)
)
PARTITION BY RANGE (hire_date) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN ('2000-01-01'),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN ('2010-01-01'),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE)
);
```

### **Best Practices:**

* Use partitioning for very large tables.
* Choose a partition key that evenly distributes data.
* Regularly monitor and maintain partitions.
