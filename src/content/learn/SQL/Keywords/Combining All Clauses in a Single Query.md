To see how these clauses can be combined, consider this comprehensive example:

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date > '2020-01-01'
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
ORDER BY employee_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### **Explanation:**
1. **WHERE hire_date > '2020-01-01':** Filters employees hired after January 1, 2020.
2. **GROUP BY department:** Groups the remaining employees by department.
3. **HAVING COUNT(*) > 5:** Only includes groups (departments) with more than 5 employees.
4. **ORDER BY employee_count DESC:** Orders the groups by the number of employees in descending order.
5. **LIMIT 5:** Limits the result to the top 5 departments.

### **Use Case:**
Finding the top 5 departments with the highest number of employees hired after January 1, 2020, where each department has more than 5 such employees.
