### **Explanation:**
The N+1 query problem occurs when a single query is followed by N additional queries to fetch related data, leading to performance issues.

### **Solution:**
Use joins or subqueries to fetch all required data in a single query.

### **Example:**
```sql
-- N+1 Problem
SELECT * FROM departments;
-- For each department, fetch employees
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = ?;

-- Solution
SELECT d.department_name, e.first_name, e.last_name
FROM departments d
JOIN employees e ON d.department_id = e.department_id;
```
