### **Explanation:**
Caching involves storing frequently accessed data in memory to reduce database load and improve query performance.

### **Strategies:**
- Use application-level caching (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
- Utilize database-level caching mechanisms.
- Implement query results caching for expensive operations.
- Cache static data that rarely changes.
