### **Explanation:**
- **Normalization:** Organizing the database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
- **Denormalization:** Introducing redundancy by adding derived data to improve read performance.

### **Best Practices:**
- Normalize tables to reduce data redundancy and improve integrity.
- Denormalize for read-heavy systems where query performance is a bottleneck.
- Use summary tables for pre-aggregated data.
