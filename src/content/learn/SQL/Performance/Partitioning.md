### **Explanation:**
Partitioning divides a table into smaller, more manageable pieces, improving query performance and maintenance.

### **Types of Partitioning:**
- **Range Partitioning:** Based on a range of values.
- **List Partitioning:** Based on a list of values.
- **Hash Partitioning:** Based on a hash function.
- **Composite Partitioning:** Combination of the above methods.

### **Syntax:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    hire_date DATE,
    department VARCHAR(50)
)
PARTITION BY RANGE (hire_date) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN ('2000-01-01'),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN ('2010-01-01'),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE)
);
```

### **Best Practices:**
- Use partitioning for very large tables.
- Choose a partition key that evenly distributes data.
- Regularly monitor and maintain partitions.
