# **Guide to Stored Procedures in SQL**

## **1. What is a Stored Procedure?**

### **Explanation:**
A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save and reuse. You can pass parameters to stored procedures, and they can return results, execute complex logic, and perform data modifications. Stored procedures help in encapsulating logic, improving performance, and maintaining consistency.

### **Benefits:**
- **Performance:** Reduced client-server communication and precompiled execution.
- **Security:** Restrict direct access to data by encapsulating business logic.
- **Reusability:** Encapsulated logic can be reused across applications.
- **Maintainability:** Centralized logic that simplifies updates and debugging.

## **2. Basic Syntax**

### **Creating a Stored Procedure:**
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
AS
BEGIN
    -- SQL statements
END;
```

### **Executing a Stored Procedure:**
```sql
EXEC procedure_name;
```

### **Example:**
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetAllEmployees
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM employees;
END;
```

### **Execution:**
```sql
EXEC GetAllEmployees;
```

---

## **3. Stored Procedures with Parameters**

### **Explanation:**
Parameters allow you to pass data to the stored procedure and make it dynamic.

### **Syntax:**
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
    @parameter_name datatype,
    @another_parameter_name datatype
AS
BEGIN
    -- SQL statements
END;
```

### **Example:**
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeesByDepartment
    @DepartmentName VARCHAR(50)
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM employees
    WHERE department = @DepartmentName;
END;
```

### **Execution:**
```sql
EXEC GetEmployeesByDepartment @DepartmentName = 'Sales';
```

---

## **4. Output Parameters**

### **Explanation:**
Output parameters allow the stored procedure to return data to the caller.

### **Syntax:**
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
    @parameter_name datatype,
    @output_parameter_name datatype OUTPUT
AS
BEGIN
    -- SQL statements
    SET @output_parameter_name = value;
END;
```

### **Example:**
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeCountByDepartment
    @DepartmentName VARCHAR(50),
    @EmployeeCount INT OUTPUT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT @EmployeeCount = COUNT(*)
    FROM employees
    WHERE department = @DepartmentName;
END;
```

### **Execution:**
```sql
DECLARE @Count INT;
EXEC GetEmployeeCountByDepartment @DepartmentName = 'Sales', @EmployeeCount = @Count OUTPUT;
PRINT @Count;
```

---

## **5. Conditional Logic in Stored Procedures**

### **Explanation:**
Stored procedures can contain conditional logic using `IF...ELSE`, `CASE`, and loops to perform complex operations.

### **Example:**
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE UpdateEmployeeSalary
    @EmployeeID INT,
    @NewSalary DECIMAL(10, 2)
AS
BEGIN
    IF @NewSalary > 0
    BEGIN
        UPDATE employees
        SET salary = @NewSalary
        WHERE employee_id = @EmployeeID;
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN
        PRINT 'Salary must be greater than 0';
    END
END;
```

### **Execution:**
```sql
EXEC UpdateEmployeeSalary @EmployeeID = 1, @NewSalary = 75000;
```

---

## **6. Transactions in Stored Procedures**

### **Explanation:**
Transactions ensure that a series of operations either all succeed or all fail, maintaining data integrity.

### **Syntax:**
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
AS
BEGIN
    BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    -- SQL statements
    COMMIT; -- or ROLLBACK;
END;
```

### **Example:**
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE TransferFunds
    @FromAccount INT,
    @ToAccount INT,
    @Amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
AS
BEGIN
    BEGIN TRANSACTION;

    BEGIN TRY
        UPDATE accounts
        SET balance = balance - @Amount
        WHERE account_id = @FromAccount;

        UPDATE accounts
        SET balance = balance + @Amount
        WHERE account_id = @ToAccount;

        COMMIT;
    END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH
        ROLLBACK;
        PRINT 'Error occurred during transaction';
    END CATCH
END;
```

### **Execution:**
```sql
EXEC TransferFunds @FromAccount = 1, @ToAccount = 2, @Amount = 1000.00;
```

---

## **7. Handling Errors in Stored Procedures**

### **Explanation:**
Using `TRY...CATCH` blocks, you can handle errors gracefully in stored procedures.

### **Example:**
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE SafeUpdateEmployeeSalary
    @EmployeeID INT,
    @NewSalary DECIMAL(10, 2)
AS
BEGIN
    BEGIN TRY
        IF @NewSalary > 0
        BEGIN
            UPDATE employees
            SET salary = @NewSalary
            WHERE employee_id = @EmployeeID;
        END
        ELSE
        BEGIN
            THROW 50000, 'Salary must be greater than 0', 1;
        END
    END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH
        PRINT 'An error occurred: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
    END CATCH
END;
```

### **Execution:**
```sql
EXEC SafeUpdateEmployeeSalary @EmployeeID = 1, @NewSalary = -5000;
```

## **8. Stored Procedures with Dynamic SQL**

### **Explanation:**
Dynamic SQL allows you to build and execute SQL statements dynamically at runtime.

### **Syntax:**
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
    @parameter_name datatype
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @sql NVARCHAR(MAX);
    SET @sql = 'SELECT * FROM ' + @parameter_name;
    EXEC sp_executesql @sql;
END;
```

### **Example:**
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetTableData
    @TableName NVARCHAR(50)
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @sql NVARCHAR(MAX);
    SET @sql = 'SELECT * FROM ' + @TableName;
    EXEC sp_executesql @sql;
END;
```

### **Execution:**
```sql
EXEC GetTableData @TableName = 'employees';
```

---

## **9. Dropping a Stored Procedure**

### **Explanation:**
You can delete a stored procedure using the `DROP PROCEDURE` statement.

### **Syntax:**
```sql
DROP PROCEDURE procedure_name;
```

### **Example:**
```sql
DROP PROCEDURE GetAllEmployees;
```

---

## **10. Best Practices for Stored Procedures**

### **Use Descriptive Names:**
- Name procedures based on their functionality (e.g., `usp_GetEmployeeDetails`).

### **Parameter Validation:**
- Validate parameters at the beginning of the procedure.

### **Modularize Code:**
- Break down complex logic into multiple stored procedures.

### **Error Handling:**
- Use `TRY...CATCH` blocks to handle errors gracefully.

### **Documentation:**
- Comment your stored procedures for better readability and maintenance.

### **Security:**
- Use the principle of least privilege. Ensure that stored procedures execute with the appropriate permissions.
